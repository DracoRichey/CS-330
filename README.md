# CS-330
In designing software for my C++ 3D modeling project using OpenAL, I started with simple prototypes and built up features through iteration. This project improved my ability to think in 3D space, break down complex systems into manageable parts, and pair sound with visual elements for a more immersive experience. I followed an iterative design process—testing often, adjusting based on feedback, and refining the structure as I went. Throughout development, I focused more on clean, modular code and used version control to manage progress. Working on computational graphics helped me understand how math, visuals, and audio interact, and gave me skills that are useful both in school and in careers like game dev, simulations, or UI design. Overall, it’s made me more confident in building interactive, multimedia applications and solving real-world problems with code.
